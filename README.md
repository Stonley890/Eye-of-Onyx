# Eye of Onyx
A plugin that manages the royalty board on Wings of Fire: The New World

## What is this?
In the *Wings of Fire* fantasy book series, six out of the ten dragon tribes establish their queens through a battle to the death. The name, Eye of Onyx, references a necklace in the series of which is enchanted to select whoever it deems most worthy to be queen. You can read more about the canon system on the [wiki](https://wingsoffire.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_royalty). The *Wings of Fire: The New World* Minecraft server has a royalty system built on the same premise where players may climb the ranks of their respective dragon tribe and become the official ruler. However, this system, adapted to a multiplayer Minecraft server, is an extremely tedious system to upkeep manually, especially as the server grows. Scaling our size has also scaled our standards of quality, moderation, and consistency. The royalty system has been changed multiple times to adapt to these changes, but these changes have been less and less successful in managing the system and have also made it increasingly difficult for players to participate in the system.

Eye of Onyx aims to make the royalty system on *Wings of Fire: The New World* as simple to use and easy to manage as possible. I've held by two simple concepts in developing this project:
- Players should not have to understand the system to use it.
- Staff intervention and/or management should not be required at any point.
